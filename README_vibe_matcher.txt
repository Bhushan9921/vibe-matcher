At Nexora, AI helps us translate fuzzy, human ‘vibes’ into concrete product picks—closing the gap between how shoppers speak and how catalogs are indexed. This Vibe Matcher shows how lightweight embedding-based search can turn a short phrase like ‘energetic urban chic’ into relevant fashion suggestions, paving the way for richer discovery, dynamic personalization, and faster iteration across our product surfaces.

How to run:
- Local offline: `python vibe_matcher.py`
- With OpenAI embeddings: set USE_OPENAI=True in the script and add your OPENAI_API_KEY env var.
- For a notebook experience, open this .py in Colab and run all cells.
